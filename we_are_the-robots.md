<p><strong><font size="4">We are the robots</font></strong></p>
"We are the robots" is also a song of the band Kraftwerk.
But this is about us, the people. We are the robots. What does this mean? Robots are programmed electronic, electrical, mechanical and today also biological machines. If we look at the human being as a whole, we see that we have the same pattern. We are programmed by our living environment with all its influence. Our neural networks are electronic. Our vegetative system is electric. We are mechanical, even when we sleep. And last but not least, we follow a universal biological struggle, survival.

After we have described the relevant equalities, we come to what we call emotions. As you know, robots have no emotions. Which does not mean that they can not have emotions. Emotions are just as easy to program as electronic functions. Giving emotions to a robot means autonomous action. The robot is guided by his emotions. Does the robot like it or not?

We humans have emotions that are controlled and some are not. It's all about satisfaction. Our program only provides a process that has a total satisfaction as the goal. In detail and in the mass of people. We are all in relation to each other. Not like the ants, no. Much more than the ants are we connected in a collective whole, of which we only grasp a part that reaches us to orient us.

We stop at red and drive in green. Stop. What about color-blind or red-green-blind people? There is the position of the light signals above is red and below green. OK. And what about blind people? There are acoustic signals. The paths, which we go and drive are also given.

We are not just robots but a robot that can only move and act in a one-dimensional system. Only the parallel system of nature brings man to dangerous situations in which he has difficulty surviving. The civilization system continues to move away from the natural or better biology system.

And this is where the future of man begins. If we are, as proven, robots and can program ourselves, we should know where we are going, what we are doing. It is clear that survival is a priority. It is not logical to live on a three-dimensional planet in one dimension. It is a short and self-destructive life. Biological life is longer and longer.

Nature is able to make us very strong and adaptable within a very short time. It makes us supernatural survival. And in a wonderful way. We have not experienced this nature yet and we have many small obstacles that keep us away from it. But these are really just problems waiting to be solved. The rain is just one example. The rain is just wet and you should protect yourself. Taxi is not available in nature.

Because we are robots and we also want to make sense except consume, we have thought about biology and realized that we need a biological consciousness in society. Here we have bioAics launched. bioAics is a science of the future, consisting of biology, artificial intelligence and computer science.

We are interested in cooperations, especially in the field of computer science. Hardware (we) are not the problem. It is the software around which the earth revolves and thus we humans. "How do we want to be?" is one of the elementary questions of our biology today. The intention of a program gives its function.
